⦿ This is a modern single-page application
⦿ This application is built by React with Tailwind CSS Library
⦿ I used Material Tailwind to customize this web application
⦿ This application is based on the learning platform.
⦿ There are six different types of courses on my website in the courses panel.
⦿ Every single course card has an individual button that will give you more info about the targeted course.
⦿ You can download the course information in a PDF format from the course details page.
⦿ You can try premium access! But wait! You have to log in first. Otherwise, it won't show you anything!
